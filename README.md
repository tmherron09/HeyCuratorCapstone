# HeyCuratorCapstone
*See MVC_Switch Branch for Capstone repository.
Capstone Project for the Proof of Concept/Working model of the "Hey Curator" museum curation system. Currently in continuation phase as it is developed further for eventually presentation and deployment within an active scenario.

## Current State
Original repo in merge progress with final Capstone Project. Restructuring of API and cleaning up systems/services. Preparing to potentially switch into a sql/nosql combined database to abstract the non-inventory management responsibilities (Information details, Messaging, Question Board, etc) to a docuement based storage system.

### Changes from Capstone
Majority of systems are currently being reworked. 
Several services have been removed until they can be reimplemented into the current model. 
Not all code paths still work as originally functioning, but are being refactored to fit an underlying API layer.
